Claire's Custom Blender
=======

Heyo everyone! This is my custom blender repository, where I tinker with blender to customize it to my needs. 
Feel free to look around!

Most additions are in service of better 2D stylization, but I might make casual improvements if I see any
All future changes will be listed here
