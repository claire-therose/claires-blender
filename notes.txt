Notes:

Screen Space scale is controlled via:
	shader constants declared in draw_view_info.hh
	those constants are passed to the shader by gpencil_cache_utils.c
	           has access to the scene and other data ^
	common_gpencil_lib.glsl executes on that data to modulate the thickness

	1: when I say constants on the first line, that is the term used in
		the header code, but they're really more just spaces for data,
		and, unlike their name, can be changed at will
		(and they are changed in gpencil_cache_utils.c)
