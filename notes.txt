da notes

Screen Space scale is controlled via:
	shader constants declared in draw_view_info.hh
	those constants are passed to the shader by gpencil_cache_utils.c
	           has access to the scene and other data ^
	common_gpencil_lib.glsl executes on that data to modulate the thickness

	1: when I say constants on the first line, that is the term used in
		the header code, but they're really more just spaces for data,
		and, unlike their name, can be changed at will
		(and they are changed in gpencil_cache_utils.c)

Templates are stored as blend files
	default is in release/datafiles
	rest are in release/scripts/startup/bl_app_templates and in respective folders
	don't know how to create new templates yet, but might not need to
	[note]: splash image is also stored in release/datafiles
		definitely want to change that - for fun!

Icon:
	Data stored in release/darwin/Blender.app gets copied into the executable
	Icon stored in Blender.app/Contents/Resources/blender icon.icns
	This might only be a Mac thing
	see: very useful tutorial for making macOS app icons in terminal

Modifiers
	big and complex
	need to add to DNA_modifier_types.h, rna_modifier.c, MOD_modifiertypes.h, and MOD_util.c
	also need to create new file: MOD_[modifiername].c, and add that to the modifiers CMake
		located in the CMakeLists.txt file of the modifiers folder
	See 'Added framework for Squish modifier' commit on repository
	also actually see this tutorial that I followed to do this thank you Ã‰lie:
		https://blog.exppad.com/article/writing-blender-modifier
	Further:
	Display - see panel_draw of other modifiers (also needs panelRegister, they're together)
	Defaults - initData gets DNA struct through DNA_defaults.h, which gets data from:
		Default values declared in DNA_modifier_defaults.h
		registered (kind of) in dna_defaults.c
	[note]: make sure to add the methods you make to the ModifierTypeInfo list at the bottom
		things won't work without it
